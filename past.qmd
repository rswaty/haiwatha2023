## What's in this section

LANDFIRE's [Biophysical Settings (BpSs, aka "Historical Ecosystems")](https://landfire.gov/bps.php){target="blank"} represent "the vegetation system that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to Euro-American settlement and is based on both the current biophysical environment and an approximation of the historical disturbance regime." (from https://landfire.gov/bps.php). We will use this data to explore the most prevalent BpSs in a chart and map, and also the historical disturbance data that are linked to the BpSs.

## Summary
Historically 10 historical ecosystems covered roughly 90% of the Hiawatha National Forest.  More specifically:

* Wetland types (primarily the 'Laurentian-Acadian Alkaline Conifer-Hardwood Swamp' and 'Boreal Acidic Peatland Systems') were present on > 40% of the area.
* The 'Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods Forest-Hemlock' ecosystem covered ~20% of the area
* Roughly 30% of the Hiawatha had ecosytems with Mean Fire Return Intervals (MFRI) of ~100 years or less, with ~10% having a MFRI of > 10 years.
